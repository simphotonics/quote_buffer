# Quote Buffer
[![Dart](https://github.com/simphotonics/quote_buffer/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simphotonics/quote_buffer/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

## Introduction

In the context of source code generation it is required to enclose emitted strings with
(escaped) quotation marks. In the following, such strings are called *quoted strings*.
Manually delimiting strings with quotation marks is error-prone
and repetitive especially when dealing with a collection of string-items.

The package [`quote_buffer`][quote_buffer] provides [`Quote`][Quote]
an extension on Dart's [`StringBuffer`][StringBuffer] that adds  methods for
transforming single objects and lists of objects into *quoted strings*.

## Usage

To use this library include [`quote_buffer`][quote_buffer] as dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
The section below lists the methods provided
and shows the console output obtained by printing the buffer content.
It is assumed that `buffer` is an instance of [`StringBuffer`][StringBuffer].
1. **writeQ**(Object obj, {QuotationMark delimiter})

    Writes *delimiter*, *obj*, *delimiter* to the buffer.
    ```Dart
    buffer.writeQ(29);
    expect(buffer.toString(),'\'29\'');
    print(buffer.toString()); // Console output below
    ```
    ```Console
    '29'
    ```

2. **writelnQ**(Object obj, {QuotationMark delimiter})

    Writes *delimiter*, *obj*, *delimiter*, *newline symbol* to the buffer.
    ```Dart
    final bufferS = QuoteBuffer();
    buffer.writelnQ('name', delimiter: QuotationMark.double);
    expect(buffer.toString(), '\"name\"\n');
    print(buffer.toString()); // Console output below
    print('--- ---');
    ```
    ```Console
    "name"

    --- ---
    ```
3. **writeAllQ**(Iterable objects, {String separator, QuotationMark delimiter})

    Writes *delimiter*, *first object*, *delimiter*, etc. to the buffer.
    ```Dart
    buffer.writeAllQ(
      ['one','two','three'],
       separator: ', ',
    );
    expect(buffer.toString(), '\'one\', \'two\', \'three\'' );
    print(buffer.toString()); // Console output below
    ```
    ```Console
    'one', 'two', 'three'
    ```

4. **writelnAllQ**(Iterable objects, {String separator1, String separator2, QuoationMark delimiter})

    Writes *objects* in sequence: *delimiter*, *objects[0]*, *separator1*, *delimiter*, *separator2*, *newline symbol*, etc.
    ```Dart
    buffer.writelnAllQ(
      ['one','two','three'],
      separator1: ' #',
      separator2: ',',
      delimiter: QuotationMark.double,
    );
    expect(buffer.toString(), '\"one #\",\n\"two #\",\n\"three\#');
    print(buffer.toString()); // Console output below
    print('--- ---');
    ```
    ```Console
     "one #",
     "two #",
     "three"

     --- ---
    ```

## Examples

The example located in the folder [example] shows how to use the extension
[`Quote`][Quote] to simplify the generation of string literals whose content is enclosed by escaped quotation marks.
