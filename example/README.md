# Quote Buffer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/simphotonics/quote_buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/simphotonics/quote_buffer)


## Examples

The examples located in this folder show how to use the class `QuoteBuffer` to simplify the
generation of string literals whose content is enclosed by escaped quotation marks.

The file [example.dart] demonstrates how to use the methods:
- `string(Object obj)`
- `stringln(Object obj)`
- `stringAll(Iterable<Object> objects)`
- `stinglnAll(Iterable<Object> objects)`.

The intended use of `QuoteBuffer` is with source code generating packages like [code_builder].
The file [example_code_gen.dart] contains a short program illustrating how use `QuoteBuffer` with
a code builder.
